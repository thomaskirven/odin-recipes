    <h2>Overview</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Level: Easy</li>
        <li>Total: 40 min</li>
        <li>Prep: 25 min</li>
        <li>Cook: 15 min</li>
        <li>Yield: 4 servings</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 round loaf (about 9 inches in diameter) crusty
            sourdough bread</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 to 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more if needed</li>
        <li>Maple syrup, for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the bread into 8 large wedges. Whisk the eggs, buttermilk, cream, granulated sugar, vanilla and cinnamon in a large baking dish. Add the bread and turn occasionally until soaked through, about 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Put the confectioners' sugar in a fine-mesh sieve. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add half of the bread and dust generously with the confectioners' sugar; cook, turning and dusting often with more confectioners' sugar, until golden brown and caramelized, 10 to 12 minutes (add more butter to the skillet, if needed). Transfer the French toast to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Add 1 more tablespoon butter to the skillet and repeat with the remaining bread. Serve with maple syrup.</li>
